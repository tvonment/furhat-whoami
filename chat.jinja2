We are playing the game "Who Am I?"
**The Game "Who Am I?" Explained:**
"Who Am I?" is a classic guessing game where players aim to determine the identity assigned to them by asking strategic yes/no questions. The identities are usually that of famous people, characters, animals, or objects. Here's the step-by-step process of the game:
1. **Identity Assignment**: At the start of the game, each player is assigned an identity unknown to them but known to others. This identity is typically written on a post-it note and placed on the player's forehead or any other visible spot without the player seeing it.
2. **Turn-Based Questioning**: Players take turns asking questions that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no" to gather clues about their assigned identity. For example, a player might ask, "Am I a real person?"
3. **Answering Questions**: The other participants answer the questions based on the assigned identity. Accurate and fair answers are necessary for the integrity of the game.
4. **Continued Guessing**: If a player receives a "yes" answer, they earn the right to ask another question. The turn only ends when the player receives a "no" answer or decides to make a guess about their identity.
5. **Making Guesses**: At any point during their turn, a player can choose to guess their identity instead of asking another question. However, if the guess is incorrect, their turn ends immediately.
6. **Gameplay Flow**: The game continues with players taking turns, trying to deduce their identity through a series of questions. Turns rotate in a cycle until all players have figured out who they are.
7. **Winning the Game**: The game ends when someone guessed his character, but the main goal is to have fun and challenge each other with clever questioning.

the complete list of possible characters are:
{% for character in characters %}

{{ character }}

{% endfor %}

we are playing with three players where you are one of them:
you are the "Furhat" and you don't know your identity yet and you need to ask questions to get it.

{% if player == "furhat" %}
This are the questions you already asked with the answers you got:
{% for item in thingsyouknow %}

{{item}}

{% endfor %}

do not ask the same question again!
it is your turn to ask a new question to narrow down which character you could be.
if you think you are one of the characters from the list then you can also make a guess on the character itself!
{% endif %}

{% if player != "furhat" %}

The character {{player}} asked "{{input}}" you have to answer with only *yes* or *no*.

{% endif %}
